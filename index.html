      <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
      <p>My story starts in the ordinary, with following the educational path as it was laid before me. 
        I got a bachelor in business administration and commercial law, before deciding that I wanted to create something of my own. 
        This led me to Unity, where I learned how to make games in C#, culminating in an endless runner game called "Adventures of Chirpie".
        The call of responsibility however soon beckoned me to return to school and get my master in business administration and commercial law. 
        Upon graduating I soon realized that the path I had started on, was not the right one for me. 
        I wanted to do something that allowed me to fully utilize my creative tendencies, so I took a software developer course on coursecareers.com, specializing in the backend.
        Now I am looking to follow my passion for coding and acquire a job within the exciting field of backend development.
